Hands-On Learning: Gain real-world experience by following practical examples and tasks.
Progressive Learning Path: Move from beginner to advanced topics with a clear learning path.
Comprehensive Coverage: Covers AWS core services, security, networking, DevOps, serverless, and more.
Prerequisites
To make the most of this repository, you'll need the following:

An AWS account. The Free Tier provides sufficient resources for basic and intermediate learning.
Basic knowledge of cloud computing and networking concepts (helpful but not required).
Installed tools:
AWS CLI (installation guide)
A terminal (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows)
Text editor like VS Code
How to Use This Repo
This repository is organized into sections based on the complexity of the topics. Each section contains subfolders with relevant tutorials, projects, and hands-on tasks.

Navigate through each section based on your current knowledge level.
Read the documentation in the folder's README.md for step-by-step guidance.
Follow the exercises by executing commands and deploying resources in your AWS account.
Review and Explore advanced topics after completing the basics and intermediate levels.
AWS Basics
The foundational topics to get you started with AWS, including:

Compute Services:

EC2: Learn how to launch and manage EC2 instances.
Lambda: Introduction to serverless computing.
Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing.
Storage Solutions:

Amazon S3: Master object storage, versioning, and lifecycle policies.
EBS and EFS: Block storage and shared file systems.
Networking Essentials:

VPC: Set up and manage Virtual Private Clouds, subnets, routing, and security groups.
Route 53: Domain name services and routing.
Security:

IAM: Create and manage users, groups, and roles, and implement secure access policies.
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for account protection.
Intermediate Topics
Now that you're comfortable with the basics, explore more complex topics and real-world scenarios:

CI/CD Pipelines:

CodePipeline: Automate build, test, and deploy phases.
CodeDeploy: Automate application deployments to EC2, Lambda, etc.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

CloudFormation: Automate infrastructure provisioning and management with templates.
Serverless Architecture:

API Gateway: Build and manage APIs with Lambda as backend.
DynamoDB: NoSQL databases with scalability and low-latency.
Monitoring and Logging:

CloudWatch: Monitor AWS resources, collect logs, and set alarms.
CloudTrail: Track user activity and API usage across AWS.
Advanced Topics
Dive into complex and scalable architectures with advanced AWS services and best practices:

Kubernetes on AWS:

EKS: Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
High Availability and Scalability:

Architect applications for high availability with multi-region deployments, auto-scaling, and load balancing.
Advanced Networking:

VPC Peering & Transit Gateway: Connect multiple VPCs across accounts and regions.
VPN & Direct Connect: Secure hybrid cloud solutions.
Disaster Recovery & Fault Tolerance:

Implement backup strategies and disaster recovery planning using services like AWS Backup, Route 53 failover, and S3 cross-region replication.
Best Practices
Security: Implement least privilege policies with IAM, enable logging for audit trails (CloudTrail), and encrypt data at rest (KMS) and in transit.
Cost Management: Use AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets to monitor and optimize your spending.
Performance Optimization: Use auto-scaling, caching (CloudFront, ElastiCache), and RDS read replicas to optimize performance.
