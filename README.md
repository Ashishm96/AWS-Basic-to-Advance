## AWS Basics

The foundational topics to get you started with AWS, including:

- **Compute Services**:
  - [EC2](./basics/EC2.md): Learn how to launch and manage EC2 instances.
  - [Lambda](./basics/Lambda.md): Introduction to serverless computing.
  - Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing.

- **Storage Solutions**:
  - [Amazon S3](./basics/S3.md): Master object storage, versioning, and lifecycle policies.
  - EBS and EFS: Block storage and shared file systems.

- **Networking Essentials**:
  - [VPC](./basics/VPC.md): Set up and manage Virtual Private Clouds, subnets, routing, and security groups.
  - [Route 53](./basics/Route53.md): Domain name services and routing.
  
- **Security**:
  - [IAM](./basics/IAM.md): Create and manage users, groups, and roles, and implement secure access policies.
  - MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for account protection.

## Intermediate Topics

Now that you're comfortable with the basics, explore more complex topics and real-world scenarios:

- **CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - [CodePipeline](./intermediate/CodePipeline.md): Automate build, test, and deploy phases.
  - [CodeDeploy](./intermediate/CodeDeploy.md): Automate application deployments to EC2, Lambda, etc.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
  - [CloudFormation](./intermediate/CloudFormation.md): Automate infrastructure provisioning and management with templates.

- **Serverless Architecture**:
  - [API Gateway](./intermediate/APIGateway.md): Build and manage APIs with Lambda as backend.
  - [DynamoDB](./intermediate/DynamoDB.md): NoSQL databases with scalability and low-latency.

- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - [CloudWatch](./intermediate/CloudWatch.md): Monitor AWS resources, collect logs, and set alarms.
  - CloudTrail: Track user activity and API usage across AWS.

## Advanced Topics

Dive into complex and scalable architectures with advanced AWS services and best practices:

- **Kubernetes on AWS**:
  - [EKS](./advanced/EKS.md): Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on AWS.
  
- **High Availability and Scalability**:
  - Architect applications for high availability with multi-region deployments, auto-scaling, and load balancing.

- **Advanced Networking**:
  - [VPC Peering & Transit Gateway](./advanced/VPCPeering.md): Connect multiple VPCs across accounts and regions.
  - VPN & Direct Connect: Secure hybrid cloud solutions.

- **Disaster Recovery & Fault Tolerance**:
  - Implement backup strategies and disaster recovery planning using services like AWS Backup, Route 53 failover, and S3 cross-region replication.

---

## Best Practices

- **Security**: Implement least privilege policies with IAM, enable logging for audit trails (CloudTrail), and encrypt data at rest (KMS) and in transit.
- **Cost Management**: Use AWS Cost Explorer and Budgets to monitor and optimize your spending.
- **Performance Optimization**: Use auto-scaling, caching (CloudFront, ElastiCache), and RDS read replicas to optimize performance.
